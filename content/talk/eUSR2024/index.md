summary: "Obesity is a growing global concern according to the World Health Organization. For instance, over 160 million children were classified as obese in 2022 by this organization. One of the main contributors to obesity is a low intake of fiber, which disrupts gut microbiota and promotes fat accumulation in the liver. High-fiber diets have been shown to regulate lipid and glucose metabolism, helping to address obesity-related conditions. However, the development of these diets relies on traditional statistical methods such as ANOVA, which does not reveal a potential interaction between the type of diet and the fiber supplement. To overcome this limitation, we propose a factorial analysis to study this interaction. We illustrate our method using a real experiment involving two diets, a standard diet and a high-fat diet, and a supplement with high fiber from mango peel and bagasse. The experiment had 24 male Wistar rats and its response under study was the liver fat droplets, a key obesity biomarker. Our analysis showed a significant interaction between the supplement and the diet, which was not revealed by an analysis based on ANOVA. The interaction reveals that the high-fiber mango supplement has a large effect on reducing the liver fat droplets of rats with a high-fat diet. This interaction is key to understanding how diet and supplements work together to reduce obesity-related biomarkers. "
