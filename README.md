## Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Arkansas](https://industrial-engineering.uark.edu/). Previously, I was an Assistant Adjunct Professor at the [Department of Statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles](http://statistics.ucla.edu/), and a Junior Postdoctoral Fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders ([FWO](https://www.fwo.be/en/)), Belgium. From July 2018 to September 2019, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Biosystems at [KU Leuven](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/english), Belgium. In May 2018, I obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Economics at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/about-uantwerp/faculties/faculty-of-business-and-economics/), Belgium. The supervisors of my Ph.D. thesis were Prof. [Peter Goos](http://www.experimental-design.eu/who/) and Dr. [Eric Schoen](http://www.experimental-design.eu/who/). You can find a copy of my CV in this [link](https://github.com/alanrvazquez/alanrvazquez.github.io/blob/main/cv_Alan_Vazquez.pdf).

My research interests include:
- Optimum Experimental Design
- Computer Experiments
- Model Selection
- Discrete Optimization

I was born and raised in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
