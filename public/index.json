This study aimed to analyze how the combination of microwave (MW) drying and convective heated air drying influences the quality of instantized rice. Novel approaches for drying precooked rice were explored, involving the utilization of an industrial MW operating at a frequency of 915 MHz with treatment conditions set at 4 kW power for 8 min. This was followed by two distinct convective oven drying strategies, each lasting 4 min. Specifically, stepwise convective hot air drying involved progressively decreasing temperatures, while constant temperature convective hot air drying maintained a consistent temperature. The convective hot air-drying temperatures ranged from 160°C to 230°C, while the constant temperature options were either 160°C or 200°C. Both strategies encompassed three relative humidity levels (20%, 40%, and 60%). The impact of these techniques on the quality attributes of a newly developed long-grain (LG) hybrid rice variety, RT 7521 FP, was assessed.\nThe drying approach and percentage RH significantly impacted the percentage points of moisture removed, with both their p values smaller than .01. For water activity, the main effect of the drying approach was significant because the p values of its hypothesis test were smaller than .05. The results showed that increasing the percentage of RH increases the mean water activity under the constant medium, constant high, and stepwise medium approaches. MW drying followed by a Constant high approach under 40% RH had a higher rehydration ratio value of instantized rice than all other drying treatments. The second highest rehydration ratio was observed in MW drying, followed by stepwise high treatments. None of the effects of the factors of RH and drying approach were significant for the rehydration ratio because their p values were all larger than .05. For bulk density, the main effects of RH and the drying approach were not significant since their p values were larger than .05. The drying temperature had significant impacts on textural parameters such as hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, and resilience, except springiness. RH impacted both adhesiveness and resilience. All parameters measured, including percentage RH and drying approach, did not significantly impact the rehydration ratio, color, and bulk density of treated instant rice samples (p smaller than 0.05).\nPrediction profiler for multiattribute optimization using a desirability function approach from John's Macintosh Project Pro 17 statistical software was used to identify the best setting of RH and the drying approach that maximizes the percentage of moisture content removed, minimizes water activity, and reaches an adhesiveness and resilience values close to −4.615 and 0.6722, respectively. The best setting for RH was identified as 20%, and the best drying approach was stepwise high. Under these settings, the predicted mean percentage of moisture removed, water activity, adhesiveness, and resilience of the models were 44.43%, 0.478, −9.02, and 0.5, respectively. Therefore, these settings are recommended to achieve rice samples with attractive moisture content removed, water activity, adhesiveness, and resilience.\nThe study has provided crucial information on the instantizing potential of a new variety of hybrid rice and the feasibility of combining a 915 MHz industrial MW and convective hot air to dry and obtain instant rice with improved quality attributes, including high rehydration ratios for shorter cooking times, lighter weight, and longer shelf life. The information generated from this study may be useful to guide decisions on drying conditions for industrial processing of instantized rice with premium quality.","tags":["published"],"title":"Quality characteristic of instant rice produced using microwave-assisted hot air drying","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan Roberto Vazquez","Weng Kee Wong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1707350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707350400,"objectID":"001eda63b2a3781559fb388117053fd6","permalink":"/publication/mip_trials/","publishdate":"2024-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mip_trials/","section":"publication","summary":"Modern randomization methods in clinical trials are invariably adaptive, meaning that the assignment of the next subject to a treatment group uses the accumulated information in the trial. Some of the recent adaptive randomization methods use mathematical programming to construct attractive clinical trials that balance the group features, such as their sizes and covariate distributions of their subjects. We review some of these methods and compare their performance with common covariate-adaptive randomization methods for small clinical trials. We introduce an energy distance measure that compares the discrepancy between the two groups using the joint distribution of the subjects' covariates. This metric is more appealing than evaluating the discrepancy between the groups using their marginal covariate distributions. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of the mathematical programming methods under the new measure.

These designs have each factor at two levels and are traditionally constructed using standard algorithms, which rely on a pre-specified linear model. Since the assumed model may depart from the truth, two-level $Q_B$-optimal designs have been developed to provide efficient parameter estimates for several potential models. These designs also have an overarching goal that models that are more likely to be the best for explaining the data are estimated more efficiently than the rest. However, there is no effective algorithm for constructing them. This article proposes two methods: a mixed-integer programming algorithm that guarantees convergence to the two-level $Q_B$-optimal designs; and, a heuristic algorithm that employs a novel formula to find good designs in short computing times. Using numerical experiments, we show that our mixed-integer programming algorithm is attractive to find small optimal designs, and our heuristic algorithm is the most computationally-effective approach to construct both small and large designs, when compared to benchmark heuristic algorithms.","tags":["published"],"title":"Constructing two-level $Q_B$-optimal screening designs using mixed-integer programming and heuristic algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric D.

In P22-infected Salmonella Typhimurium populations, however, we find that host subpopulations become lytically consumed despite high phage-to-host ratios that would normally favor lysogeny. These subpopulations originate from the proliferation of P22-free siblings that spawn off from P22-carrier cells from which they cytoplasmically inherit P22-borne superinfection exclusion factors (SEFs). In fact, we demonstrate that the gradual dilution of these SEFs in the growing subpopulation of P22-free siblings restricts the number of incoming phages, thereby imposing the perception of a low phage-to-host ratio that favors lytic development. Although their role has so far been neglected, our data indicate that phage-borne SEFs can spur complex infection dynamics and a history-dependent switch from vertical to horizontal transmission in the face of host-cell scarcity.","tags":["published"],"title":"Superinfection exclusion factors drive a history-dependent switch from vertical to horizontal phage transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan Roberto Vazquez"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1637751600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637751600,"objectID":"d7bff4ff174f1e0ae0a843f1c2017199","permalink":"/talk_templates/douglas/","publishdate":"2021-11-24T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk_templates/douglas/","section":"talk_templates","summary":"Douglas Research Centre CIC Imaging Series Lecture","tags":[],"title":"fMRI signatures of deep anesthesia in primates and rodents","type":"talk_templates"},{"authors":["Alan Roberto Vazquez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627257600,"objectID":"817eb2869dfcd0ed63b6599f8180b503","permalink":"/talk/qrpc2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/qrpc2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Two-level orthogonal screening designs with 80, 96 and 112 runs: Construction and evaluation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Remco Kort","Job Schlösser","Alan Roberto Vazquez","Prudence Atukunda","Grace K.

In this study we investigated the association of gut microbiota composition with language development of 3-year-old rural Ugandan children.\nMethods: We studied the language ability in 139 children of 36 months in our controlled maternal education intervention trial to stimulate children’s growth and development. The dataset includes 1170 potential predictors, including anthropometric and cognitive parameters at 24 months, 542 composition parameters of the children’s gut microbiota at 24 months and 621 of these parameters at 36 months. We applied a novel computationally efficient version of the all-subsets regression methodology and identified predictors of language ability of 36-months-old children scored according to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III).\nResults: The best three-term model, selected from more than 266 million models, includes the predictors Coprococcus eutactus at 24 months of age, Bifidobacterium at 36 months of age, and language development at 24 months. The top 20 four-term models, selected from more than 77 billion models, consistently include C. eutactus abundance at 24 months, while 14 of these models include the other two predictors as well. Mann–Whitney U tests suggest that the abundance of gut bacteria in language non-impaired children (n = 78) differs from that in language impaired children (n = 61). While anaerobic butyrate-producers, including C. eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Holdemanella biformis, Roseburia hominis are less abundant, facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Granulicatella elegans, Escherichia/Shigella and Campylobacter coli, are more abundant in language impaired children. The overall predominance of oxygen tolerant species in the gut microbiota was slightly higher in the language impaired group than in the non-impaired group (P = 0.09).\nConclusion: Application of the all-subsets regression methodology to microbiota data established a correlation between the relative abundance of the anaerobic butyrate-producing gut bacterium C. eutactus and language development in Ugandan children. We propose that the gut redox potential and the overall bacterial butyrate-producing capacity in the gut are important factors for language development.","tags":["published"],"title":"Model Selection Reveals the Butyrate-Producing Gut Bacterium Coprococcus eutactus as Predictor for Language Development in 3-Year-Old Rural Ugandan Children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan Roberto Vazquez","Eric D.

In these cases, it is common practice to arbitrarily drop the last columns of the larger design.

The problem is solved by finding the server roster, defined as the allocation of active individual servers in each time interval of the working day.

The complex queueing system was solved by a simulation-based heuristic that includes the dynamic arrivals, entity reneging and/or balking, multi-servicing, and the individual service-time distributions of servers. The distributions of the random variables of single or multiple-branch businesses were identified by sampling procedures for multiple company-branch deployment. The beneficial financial impact of the proposed solution is confirmed in numerical real-life banking scenarios. The quality perceived by customers (evaluated through the expected queueing time) was also improved. Finally, additional insights that might improve the system performance are highlighted.","tags":["published"],"title":"A simulation-based heuristic that promotes business profit while increasing the perceived quality of service industries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter T.

These arrays are classified into regular and nonregular designs. Good regular designs are available in the literature for large run sizes that are a power of 2. In contrast, good nonregular designs, which have run sizes that are multiples of 8 and are more flexible alternatives to regular designs, are not available for large numbers of runs because their construction is challenging. In this article, we introduce a collection of strength-3 nonregular designs with large run sizes that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been explored before in the design literature. Using theoretical results and algorithmic approaches, we construct nonregular designs with up to 1280 runs. Our designs fill the gaps between the available strength-3 designs with large run sizes and outperform many comparably sized benchmark designs in terms of the aliasing among the two-factor interactions. We show the applicability of our collection of strength-3 designs using an infrared sensor experiment. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.","tags":["published"],"title":"Construction of Two-Level Nonregular Designs of Strength Three With Large Run Sizes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Britt Maestroni","Alan Roberto Vazquez","Valeria Avossa","Peter Goos","Veronica Cesio","Horacio Heinzen","Joerg Riener","Andrew Cannavan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540339200,"objectID":"bfd7b934d9766e9d633385f38adfeb9e","permalink":"/publication/potato/","publishdate":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/potato/","section":"publication","summary":"The best demonstration of the ruggedness of a method is monitoring its performance on an ongoing basis as part of the analytical quality control applied in the laboratory. However, an initial demonstration of the ruggedness is often performed as one aspect of the method validation, to give confidence that the method should perform well under normal variations in conditions in routine application. This initial ruggedness testing is typically performed using either multiple replicate analyses or application of design of experiments (DoEs) which minimizes the number of analyses, time and effort required to detect influences on the measurement results. Two DoEs were applied for ruggedness testing for a modified QuEChERS multiresidue method for the detection of pesticide residues in potato by GC–MS/MS. Seven experimental factors were studied using an eight-run Plackett–Burman design replicated three times and an augmented definitive screening design with 34 runs. The relative effectiveness of the two approaches is discussed, in terms of their statistical significance, their cost-effectiveness and the richness of information they provide on the effects of the parameters investigated and the actual robustness of the method being tested.","tags":["published"],"title":"Ruggedness testing of an analytical method for pesticide residues in potato","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan Roberto Vazquez","Peter Goos","Eric D.

If they consist of N/2 mirror image pairs, these designs are fold-over designs. They are called even and provide at most N/2 − 1 degrees of freedom to estimate interactions. For k \u003c N/3 factors, there exist strength-3 designs that are not fold-over designs. They are called even-odd designs and they provide many more degrees of freedom to estimate interactions. For N ⩽ 48, attractive even-odd designs can be extracted from complete catalogs of strength-3 orthogonal arrays. However, for larger run sizes, no complete catalogs exist. To construct even-odd designs with N \u003e 48, we develop an algorithm for an optimal concatenation of strength-3 designs involving N/2 runs. Our approach involves column permutations of one of the concatenated designs, as well as sign switches of the elements of one or more columns of that design. We illustrate the potential of the algorithm by generating two-level even-odd designs with 64 and 128 runs involving up to 33 factors, because this allows a comparison with benchmark designs from the literature. With a few exceptions, our even-odd designs outperform or are competitive with the benchmark designs in terms of the aliasing of two-factor interactions and in terms of the available degrees of freedom to estimate two-factor interactions.

Several methods for constructing efficient longitudinal designs have been developed based on power analysis and the statistical model used for analyzing the final results. However, development of this technology is not available to practitioners through user-friendly software. In this paper we introduce LADES (Longitudinal Analysis and Design of Experiments Software) as an alternative and easy-to-use tool for conducting longitudinal analysis and constructing efficient longitudinal designs. LADES incorporates methods for creating cost-efficient longitudinal designs, unequal longitudinal designs, and simple longitudinal designs. In addition, LADES includes different methods for analyzing longitudinal data such as linear mixed models, generalized estimating equations, among others. A study of European eels is reanalyzed in order to show LADES capabilities. Three treatments contained in three aquariums with five eels each were analyzed. Data were collected from 0 up to the 12th week post treatment for all the eels (complete design). The response under evaluation is sperm volume. A linear mixed model was fitted to the results using LADES. The complete design had a power of 88.7% using 15 eels. With LADES we propose the use of an unequal design with only 14 eels and 89.5% efficiency. LADES was developed as a powerful and simple tool to promote the use of statistical methods for analyzing and creating longitudinal experiments in biomedical research.","tags":["published"],"title":"LADES: A Software for Constructing and Analyzing Longitudinal Designs in Biomedical Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan Roberto Vazquez","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"5e3e9ae1144bdf3ebd068a83141ddef6","permalink":"/publication_templates/example_conference_paper/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication_templates/example_conference_paper/","section":"publication_templates","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
